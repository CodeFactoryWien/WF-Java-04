##1. Column##
1) RoomType -> Price per day is shown;
		All roomtypes are get from database when you open "New Booking";
		Free rooms of selected type is shown;
		When no free rooms of the selected type are available -> alert is fired; 
2) TotalPrice -> Is shown only when all 3 fields in column1 are filled;
		They also can be changed and values change;
		CheckIn must be before CheckOut date otherwise totalprice = "///"
*) When the fields are empty and the user try to book -> alert is fired;
*) When all fields are correctly filled the 2. column is activated;
*) When the checkIn date is changed back to after checkOut the 2. column is deactivated;
*) CheckIn and CheckOut are not possible to set in the past;

##2. Column##

1) ZIPCode, Phone and Passport fields only accepts numbers or P/+ as input;
2) When not all fields are filled -> alert is fired;
3) All fields except the birthdate(i think) search for the correct rows in database;
4) When you click on an entry found in the list right of the column than all
the data is collected from the database and auto filled in the correct textfields;

5) when all fields are correct and all data is filled and it was selected from the right list
than a new booking with the next free room and correct selected roomtype is created
and this room is reservated for the user found in database
6) IF the user is not selected from the list so it is a new user than also a booking is created
but also a new user is created in database;
7) If you make a mistake and select a user and than delete the fields and write a new one it also works;
8) You can close the window with cancel and it closes automatically when a booking is created;

Even when you try to trick the program and fill all fields in column 1 and autofill all fields in column2
and then set any date to the past and try to book it dont work ;-)
